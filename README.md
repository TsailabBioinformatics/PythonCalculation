# PythonCalculation  
Python code for calculation  

## GiniCorrelationCoefficient.py  
Calculate Gini Correlation Coefficient (GCC). This is one sped up version in Python of GCC from rsgcc Package  
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsgcc/index.html). The running speed is improved by   
1) parallelization. and    
2) pre-calculation of some statics per gene to avoid repetitive calculation in loops.   

numpy, multipleprocessing, pandas modules are imported in this code.  

usage:  
```
module load python/2.7.8
python GiniCorrelationCoefficient.py    matrix   output    threadnum  
```
matrix :    input matrix file with headline(sample IDs) and row names(gene IDs), each row contains data for each gene.   
output:     output file  
threadnum:  number of cores to be used
